# User Controlled DDR Autoprecharge preview

This is a preview of a new user controlled autoprecharge feature that provides the `cl_sh_ddr_awuser` and
`cl_sh_ddr_aruser` user bits in the DDR-C(Shell) Controller to control DDR Autoprecharge. The feature is provided by the AWS Shell v12142010.

A use-case of the new shell is provided in the [cl_dram_dma example](./hdk/cl/examples/cl_dram_dma/README.md) 
and the user bits are tied off to 0. You can follow the same steps to create your own CL using the new shell. The CL build scripts will automatically point to the new shell.

‚ö†Ô∏è <b>NOTE:</b> CL's with Shell v12142010 require Xilinx 2020.1 Toolset with patch AR75524. The Patch will be automatically applied 
when you run `hdk_setup.sh`

Patch AR75524 allows Xilinx 2020.1 toolset to generate the DDR controller IP with user bits to control DDR Autoprecharge.

‚ö†Ô∏è <b>NOTE:</b> Shell v12142010 is only available to use in `us-east-1` and on F1.16XL instances.

# Getting Started

### Getting familiar with AWS
If you have never used AWS before, we recommend you start with [AWS getting started training](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/), and focus on the basics of the [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) and [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) services. 
Understanding the fundamentals of these services will make it easier to work with AWS F1 and the FPGA Developer Kit.

FPGA Image generation and EC2 F1 instances are supported in the us-east-1 (N. Virginia), us-west-2 (Oregon), eu-west-1 (Ireland) and us-gov-west-1 ([GovCloud US](https://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/)) [regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è <b>NOTE:</b> By default, your AWS Account will have an EC2 F1 Instance launch limit of 0. 
> Before using F1 instances, you will have to open a [Support Case](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create) to increase the EC2 Instance limits to allow launching F1 instances.

### Setting up development environment for the first time 

You have the choice to develop on AWS EC2 using the [FPGA Developer AMI](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B06VVYBLZZ) or on-premise. 

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è <b>INFO:</b> We suggest starting with the FPGA Developer AMI with [build instances](#fpga-developer-ami) on EC2 as it has Xilinx tools and licenses setup for you to be able to quickly get into development.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è <b>INFO:</b> For on-premise development, you will need to have [Xilinx tools and licenses available for you to use](./docs/on_premise_licensing_help.md)

1. Start a Build Instance first to start your development. 
    > üí° <b>TIP:</b> This instance does not have to be an F1 instance. You only require an F1 instance to run your AFI's(Amazon FPGA Image) once you have gone through your design build and AFI creation steps.
    
    > ‚ÑπÔ∏è <b>INFO:</b> If you need to follow GUI Development flows, please checkout our [Developer Resources](./developer_resources/README.md) where we provide Step-By-Step guides to setting up a GUI Desktop.
1. Clone the [FPGA Developer Kit](https://github.com/aws/aws-fpga) on your instance.
    ```git clone https://github.com/aws/aws-fpga.git```
1. Follow the quickstarts from the next section.

### Quickstarts
Before you create your own AWS FPGA design, we recommend that you go through one of the step-by-step Quickstart guides:
